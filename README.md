# caveman-project

Project caveman is directed toward people who would like to start their experience with caving.
The most common questions from cave-baginners is "What should I take with me to the cave? What should I wear? What equipment is needed?".
Caveman help to answer those questions.

Project is fully designed and written by Joanna Wola≈Ñska who used: HTML5, CSS, JS, JQ, RWD, Sass for this project.
As you may see - man scheme is drawn using CSS.

Before man scheme appears you have to make some choices.

What is very important in main part of project is correct order of choosing elements of equipment of caveman. To prevent wearing clothes and equipment in incorrect order I used number of if/else statements. Was is possible to use any less complex solution? Not in this case. There are to many conditions which needs to be met. 
If you choose element which has to be choosen after another one - this element will disappear and will be shown in cave-bag. When you choose element which needs to be choosen before hidden element - this element will be back on list of equipment on the left side. If you choose it now - it will be shown on man scheme and will disappear from cave-bag.

When all elements are choosen - if you mouseenter caveman - end information will appear automatically. If you do not have time to wear all equipment - please click on caveman - same end information will appear.

Try to choose your way to start adventure and have fun. I will appreciate all tips regarding my project.
